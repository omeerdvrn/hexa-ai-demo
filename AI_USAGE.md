## AI Tools Used

- **NotebookLM**
- **ChatGPT**
- **Claude**
- **Claude Code**

## What Each Tool Was Used For (Categories)

- **NotebookLM (Planning Stage)**  
  I uploaded the case study document and used NotebookLM to generate a detailed, step-by-step task list for both backend and frontend development. This helped me break the project into clear phases before starting implementation.

- **ChatGPT & Claude Code (Implementation Stage)**  
  While building the project, I consulted both tools for debugging assistance, clarifying best practices, and generating or refining code snippets when I encountered blockers.

- **Claude & Claude Code (Review Stage)**  
  At the end of the project, I used these tools for code review, checking structure, readability, and possible improvements before finalizing the project.

## Prompts I Found Especially Useful

1. **Planning Prompt (NotebookLM)**  
   _“Here is the full case study document. Generate a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of all tasks I need to complete, separated into backend and frontend responsibilities. Include dependencies and recommended order.”_

2. **Implementation Prompt (ChatGPT/Claude Code)**  
   _“I'm building storing image in the cloud storage feature. In generate_mock_image_url, return this storage url as result_url. Here is my current code. What is the cleanest and most maintainable way to implement this? Suggest improvements without changing the core logic.”_

## Reflection (5–10 Sentences)

AI tools were especially helpful in the planning phase by breaking down the entire project into clear, actionable tasks. NotebookLM handled the case study context very well and provided a structured roadmap that saved significant time. During implementation, ChatGPT and Claude Code were useful for debugging and clarifying concepts that would have taken longer to research manually. However, I often had to adjust AI-generated code to better match my architecture, naming conventions, or technical constraints. Some suggestions were too generic or didn’t fully consider previous design decisions, so I had to modify the outputs.

In the review stage, Claude provided high-quality feedback on structure and readability, helping me refine the final version of the project. Despite using AI throughout the process, I deliberately wrote all core logic myself to ensure I fully understood every part of the system. Overall, AI accelerated my workflow, but I remained responsible for decisions, architecture, and final implementation quality.
